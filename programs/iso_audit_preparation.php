      <div class="strong">What is Zastra's ISO Audit preparation services ?</div>
      This service enables an organization that might be going in for an ISO 9001 audit to check its audit preparedness before it goes in for an audit. 
      
      <br/><br/>

      <div class="strong">Why do I need ISO Audit "preparation" ? </div>
      In the experience of the Zastra team, many teams are poorly prepared for any software audit and require hand holding by experienced hands. This is observed in spite of having well documented procedures and processes, checklists. 
      
      <br/><br/>

      <div class="strong">What is the methodology for checking preparedness ? </div>
      Zastra will engage with your management team, your QA organization, your IT development and testing team and other stakeholders to check your preparedness. Zastra will conduct a detailed assessment using its set of questionnaires and detailed checklists. 
      
      <br/><br/>

      At the end of the assessment Zastra team would present a detailed report on your organization's preparedness for the audit in the areas of management control, software development processes in terms of as-is state, gaps found and best practices to be adopted.
